Tronic Revamped Changelog

v1	- Added full biome support
	- Changed wool, snow, and iron blocks so that you could actually tell them apart.
	- Made metal blocks look more metallic.
	- Changed clay block color from gray to peach to make clay easier to spot.
	- New icons, thanks to Frenden.
	- Round sun and Moon, thanks to Rhodox.

v2	- Tronic Revamped now ships with a No Armor version. Armor is skinned to be
		transparent so that you can see players's custom skins.
	- Removed pumpkin face on pumpkins not being used as lanterns. 

v3	- Fully compatible with Beta 1.2
	- Dyes are now textured according to hierarchy. 'Primary' dyes look like the resource
		they came from (rose petals, cactus leaf, crushed bones). 'Secondary', or mixed,
		dyes are textured to come in small metal bowls.
	- Added new wool colors.
	- Added sandstone.
	- Changed brick texture to actually look like bricks. It can tile with sandstone, so
		brick+sandstone buildings are possible.
	- Added squid skin (basically just a resized default skin because I got lazy).
	- Improved block breaking progress bar.
	- Snowballs are now less blue.

v4	- Changed water color to teal
	- Removed tiling effect from lava. This was the most elegant way to enforce the
		danger of lava without breaking from the minimalist style of Tronic. Seeing a
		solid patch of orange (without the grid lines present on every other block) should
		immediately make you wary.
	- IMPROVED UNDERWATER VISION AND NIGHT VISION! Finally found the textures that govern
		these and improved them. You no longer have annoying foggy pixels in front of you
		when diving, and walking around in darkness will no longer make the edges of
		your screen dark and give you tunnel vision.
	- New paintings made from popular NES games.
	- Made pine needles thinner.
	- Changed chests and workbenches to reflect their made-from-planks nature.
	- Changed furnace and dispenser textures.
	- Furnaces, chests, dispensers and workbenches now tile when placed next
		to each other. The effect is like a kitchen bench, with an overhang that is
		consistent between them. This was mainly done to allow the creation of
		kitchens in the game.
	- Made diamond ore brighter, both to help spot it and to help differentiate it from
		lapis lazuli ore.
	- Fixed unnoticeable transparency bug with cake.
	
v5	- Added new item textures and icons for Beta 1.3.
	- Darkened pine bark texture color.
	- Changed back to the original Tronic version of brick.
	- Changed sandstone texture to suit revision of brick.
	- Redid Squid texture.

v6	- Added Mystery Block and Cookie textures (used the stock textures for both, because the
		cookie one was nice already, and the Mystery Block isn't even in the game).
	- Added new Wolf textures.
	- Removed the redstone trail textures (they have been removed from Beta 1.4.)

v7	- Added new saplings.
	- Changed Mystery Block to new biome-compliant grassy sides.
	- Added powered rails and detector block. Hopefully the detector block is more obvious
		at a distance than the stock design was.
	- Fixed transparency on some blue block, which I can only assume was water (never seen it).
	- Added new power.png to Transparent Armor variant of Tronic Revamped.
	- Darkened wolf skin a bit.
	
v8	- Added trapdoor.
	- Added new particle effects.
	- Added item icon for map.
	- Did NOT redo map texture or map markers. They were fine as-is, and maps should be as
		standardised as possible, I think.
	- Removed MrMMods Pack steps from installation instructions.

v8b 	- Added tall grasses.

v9	- Added shears.
	- Added new texture for fishing rod without fishing line.
	- Added pistons!
	- I noticed the new Silverfish mod texture, but since it's presently unused, I have not
		included it.
	- Moved cake and bed textures downwards to match new texture alignment.

v10	- Thanks to Shamus (Minecraft name Shamus03) for the following texture additions:
		- Added custom fire textures.
		- Added custom lava textures.
		- Added custom portal texture.
		- Added Connected Textures Mod support.
		- Added subtle "Use the patcher, noob" message to terrain.png for improperly
			patched packs.
	- Removed power.png from Invisi-Armor version of Tronic.

v11	- Added new textures and icons for all new 1.8 Adventure Update blocks and items, except:
		- Enderman
		- Cave spider
		- Silverfish
		- Rotten meat
		- Seeds

		- Made squid mouth less terrifying and Cthulhu-like.
		- Added Mooshroom.
		- Added Blaze.
		- Added Cave Spider.
		- Added Magma Cube.
		- Added Enderman.
		- Added Snow Golem.
		- Added all villagers.
	- Updated gui.png (had a white background with a line through it, so I added that in case
		it was important).
	- Added stock item icons. Junkboy's been doing some great ones.
	Changes to blocks:
		- Added Nether Brick.
		- Added Netherwart (stock texture).
		- Added footsteps (stock texture).

		- Added Dragon Egg.
		- Added Mycelium block.
		- Added Lilypad.
		- Added Ender Stone.
		- Added End Portal Frame.
		- Touched up the Ender Eye to make it a little clearer.
	- I didn't touch the brewing stand or cauldron because I couldn't understand how the
		textures wrapped together.

v13	Deleted sections:
		- Removed gui/gui.png. I barely changed anything inside it anyway.
	- Added stock item icons for spawn egg and some white powder type stuff. All Junkboy's!
